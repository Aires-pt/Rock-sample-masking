# Rock-sample-masking
This codes generates masks for a list of images in a semi-automated approach. Those masks can be used in photogrammetry software for 3D model reconstruction.
It was designed specifically to be integrated with Agisoft Metashape, so the masks filenames are saved following the software's template.

The code still lacks user interface options. In order to change the source or destination directory, you must hard code it.
